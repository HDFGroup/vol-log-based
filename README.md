## Log VOL - an HDF5 VOL connector for storing data in a time-log layout in files

This software repository contains source codes implementing Log VOL connector, an
[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org) Virtual Object Layer
([VOL](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer)) plugin
that stores HDF5 datasets in a storage layout similar to the time log. When using
the Log VOL connector, write requests from an MPI process are appended one after
another (as logs) in a contiguous space in the file. The contiguous spaces of
multiple processes are appended one after another following the increasing order
of processes' MPI rank IDs. Such a log layout I/O strategy avoids the expensive
inter-process communication required when storing data in the canonical order.
One of the pwoerful features of HDF5 VOL is to allow applications to make use
a VOL connector by setting two environment variables without changing the
application source codes. Using the Log VOL connector, exist HDF5 programs can
achieve a better parallel write performance with no changes to their codes.
Files created by the Log VOL conform with the HDF5 file format specification,
but require the Log VOL to read them back.
